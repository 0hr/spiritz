        <p>A. AGREEMENT:</p>
        <p>This End-User License Agreement (including the Supplemental Terms, as applicable) ("EULA") is a legal
            agreement between you and Aykut Dogru (“Aykut”, ”we", "us" or "our"). By installing or otherwise using the
            Our App s, you: (a) agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this EULA, (b) you represent and
            warrant that you own or control the mobile device in which the Our App will be installed, and (c) you
            represent and warrant that you have the right, authority and capacity to enter into this EULA and to abide
            by all its terms and conditions, just as if you had signed it. The terms and conditions of this EULA also
            apply to any Our App updates, supplements, and services that are not provided under a separate license or
            other agreement with us. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this EULA, do not install or use
            any Our App . We may amend these terms and conditions from time to time. If the changes include material
            changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify you of the changes by reasonable means. You
            acknowledge that an in-app message which notifies you of such changes when you open up the Our App shall
            constitute reasonable means. Your continued use of the Our App s after we post any amendments to this EULA
            will signify your acceptance of such amendments. If you do not agree with any amendment, you must
            discontinue using the Our App s. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the terms or conditions
            herein, please email us at info@ad-apps.com. Do not use the Our App s until your questions and concerns have
            been answered to your satisfaction and you agree to abide by the EULA. Notice to consumers: Depending on the
            laws of the jurisdiction where you live, you may have certain rights that cannot be waived through this EULA
            and that are in addition to the terms of this EULA, and certain provisions of this EULA may be unenforceable
            as to you. To the extent that any term or condition of this EULA is unenforceable, the remainder of the EULA
            shall remain in full force and effect. Use of the Our App s is subject to our Privacy Policy, which is
            hereby incorporated into this EULA by reference. This EULA also includes any additional payment terms and
            other requirements set forth on the download or purchase page through which you purchase or download the Our
            App s. The Our App s may be available through marketplaces that distribute mobile applications and that may
            have additional terms, conditions and usage rules that govern your use of the Our App s if you download or
            install the Our App s through such marketplaces.</p>
        <p>B. AGE REQUIREMENT:</p>
        <p>You must be 13 years of age or older to install or to use the Our App s. If you are at least 13 but not yet
            18 years of age, please have your parent or legal guardian review this EULA with you, discuss any questions
            you might have, and install the Our App s for you. NOTICE TO PARENTS AND GUARDIANS: By granting your child
            permission to download and access an Our App , you agree to the terms and conditions of this EULA on behalf
            of your child. You are responsible for exercising supervision over your children's online activities. If you
            do not agree to this EULA, do not let your child use the Our App s or associated features. If you are the
            parent or guardian of a child under 13 and believe that he or she is using the Our App s, please contact us
            at info@ad-apps.com.</p>
        <p>C. GRANT OF LICENSE:</p>
        <p>Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this EULA, Aykut grants you a limited,
            non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license, to access, download and install the
            most current generally available version of the Our App s on a single,</p>
        <p> authorized mobile device that you own or control solely for your lawful, personal, and non-commercial
            entertainment use.</p>
        <p>D. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS:</p>
        <p>1. Restricted Use. You may not rent, sell, lease, sublicense, distribute, assign, copy (other than a single
            copy for your own backup purposes), or in any way transfer or grant any rights to the Our App s or use the
            Our App s for the benefit of any third party. Unless expressly authorized by US or permitted under the
            applicable mobile platform terms, you are prohibited from making the Our App s available over a network
            where it could be downloaded or used by multiple users. You agree that you will not use any robot, spider,
            other automatic or manual device or process to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of
            the Our App s, except to remove our Our App s from a mobile device which you own or control. You may not
            violate or attempt to violate the security of our services. You may not modify, reverse-engineer, decompile,
            disassemble, or otherwise tamper with any Our App s, or attempt to do so for any reason or by any means. You
            may not access, create or modify the source code of any Our App s in any way. You do not have the right to
            and may not create derivative works of any Our App s or any portions thereof. All modifications or
            enhancements to the Our App s remain the sole property of US.</p>
        <p>2. Our App s Updates. We reserve the right to add or remove features or functions to existing Our App s. When
            installed on your mobile device, the Our App s periodically communicate with our servers. We may require the
            updating of the Our App s on your mobile device when we release a new version of the Our App s, or when we
            make new features available. This update may occur automatically or upon prior notice to you, and may occur
            all at once or over multiple sessions. You understand that we may require your review and acceptance of our
            then-current EULA before you will be permitted to use any subsequent versions of the Our App s. You
            acknowledge and agree that any obligation we may have to support previous versions of the Our App s may be
            ended upon the availability of updates, supplements or subsequent versions of the Our App s. You acknowledge
            and agree that we have no obligation to make available to you any updates, supplements or subsequent
            versions of the Our App s.</p>
        <p>3. Access. You must provide at your own expense the equipment, Internet connections, devices and service
            plans to access and use the Our App s. If you access an Our App through a mobile network, your network or
            roaming provider's messaging, data and other rates and fees may apply. You are solely responsible for any
            costs you incur to access the Our App s from your device. Downloading, installing or using certain Our App s
            may be prohibited or restricted by your network provider and not all Our App s may work with your network
            provider or device. Aykut makes no representation that the Our App s can be accessed on all devices or
            wireless service plans. Aykut makes no representation that the Our App s are available in all languages or
            that the Our App s are appropriate or available for use in any particular location.</p>
        <p>4. Purchases & Cancellation Rights. (A) Where you purchase from a third party: Certain Our App s are
            available for purchase from a mobile platform owner (e.g. Apple or Google) and/or will allow you to make an
            in-application purchase. Payment for such purchases may be processed by third parties who act on our behalf
            or directly by the mobile platform owner. European Union residents normally have a right to cancel online
            purchases within 14 days of making them. Please note and acknowledge: if you are resident in the European
            Union and download an Our App from a mobile platform owner (e.g. Apple or Google), you may not be able to
            cancel your</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> order or obtain a refund. Please review the mobile platform owner's terms in this regard before purchase.
            This may also apply to subscriptions and in-app purchases. You can find further information on cancelling
            orders and any associated refunds on the website of the third party re-seller from whom you purchased the
            app (for example, the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store). (B) Where you purchase from Aykut directly:
            Please note and acknowledge: if you are resident in the European Union and download an Our App from Aykut
            directly, you agree to waive your cancellation and refund right once the download of the app or the relevant
            purchase is made. This means that you will not be able to cancel your order or obtain a refund once the
            download and delivery of the app is complete. This will also apply to subscriptions and in-app purchases.
            You can find further information on cancelling orders and any associated refunds from the relevant section
            of the Aykut website.</p>
        <p>5. Subscription Services. Certain Our App s on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store will allow you to
            obtain the benefit of the application on a subscription basis. Payment for such a subscription (which may be
            for example daily, weekly, monthly, tri-monthly or yearly) may be processed in the application, by third
            parties who act on our behalf or directly by the mobile platform owner (e.g. Apple or Google). Free trial
            subscriptions may be cancelled at any point up to 24 hours before the expiry of the free trial (Apple) or at
            any time before the end of the trial period (Google). See below in paragraph 6 ("Trial Periods") for further
            information. You can cancel a subscription service at any time during the subscription period via the
            subscription settings in your iTunes or Android account. The cancellation will take effect after the last
            day in the relevant subscription period. See above in paragraph 4 ("Purchases & Cancellation Rights") for
            further information.</p>
        <p>6. Trial Periods. Certain of our subscription services on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store may from
            time to time be offered for a fixed period of time on a free-trial basis. You are free to cancel a
            free-trial subscription at any time via the subscription setting in your iTunes or Android account. Please
            note: your free-trial subscription will automatically renew as a paid subscription unless (a) auto-renew is
            turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the free-trial subscription period (Apple) or (b) you cancel
            before the end of the trial period (Google).</p>
        <p>7. Online Dispute Resolution. If you reside in the European Union, you can find information about online
            dispute resolution here: https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.show&lng=EN. Please
            note that we reserve the right not to participate in forms of alternative dispute resolution. For further
            information, please contact: info@ad-apps.com .</p>
        <p>8. Coins in the App Environment. Through your use of Our App s, you may accrue virtual "Coins" that may be
            used and virtually spent in the App environment. Coins are a limited license right distributed at our
            discretion, may only be used with respect to virtual items and services made available in the App
            environment, and are not redeemable for monetary value. In addition to the Coins that you may virtually
            accrue, you may also purchase Coins. Payments for Coins may be made through an in-app purchase (more details
            about which can be found here). Please note: we may limit the number of Coins or the total monetary value of
            Coins that you may purchase at one time, or over a given period of time, in our sole discretion. Newly
            purchased Coins credits may not be available for immediate use. If you make any unauthorized purchases of
            Coins, or if any of your purchase of Coins leads to charge-reversals, chargebacks, disputed charges, dispute
            fees, or any allegation of payment fraud, we may terminate your account, with</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> or without notice, in our sole and absolute discretion. All purchases of Coins are FINAL and non-refundable,
            except in our sole and absolute discretion. Once you purchase Coins, you cannot return them. If your account
            is cancelled or terminated by you or by us, for any reason, you will lose and forfeit any outstanding Coins
            The virtual items that you may virtually acquire or use in the App environment are a limited license right
            granted by us and you do not acquire any ownership right to any such virtual items. We may terminate such
            license right and withdraw or discontinue any virtual item in the Site environment or may remove your right
            to use any particular virtual item or service. Any exchanges of coins for virtual items are non-reversible.
            The virtual items that you may virtually acquire or use in the App environment are a limited license right
            granted by us and you do not acquire any ownership right to any such virtual items. We may terminate such
            license right and withdraw or discontinue any virtual item in the Site environment or may remove your right
            to use any particular virtual item or service. Any exchanges of coins for virtual items are non-reversible.
            Aside from the limited license to use virtual items or services as described above, you agree that you will
            not gain any right, title or interest whatsoever in the Coins, or virtual items or services, and that you
            may not trade, sell, transfer or transact Coins, or virtual items or services in any manner except as
            permitted in the App environment. You may not sell or trade the time taken to accrue Coins. Any transaction
            in Coins or virtual items or services via online auction sites or other channels outside the Services is
            strictly prohibited. You may not use cheat programs, including non-Our App s software programs, to accrue
            Coins or virtually acquire Coins. We may immediately terminate your account if it comes to our attention
            that you have accrued, virtually acquired or used Coins in any non-permitted manner.</p>
        <p>E. Our App FUNCTIONALITY:</p>
        <p>Our App s allow you to enjoy various features, functionalities and services, which may change from time to
            time (collectively, the "Our App Functions"). The Our App Functions are provided by US and third party
            suppliers who offer content and/or services in conjunction with or through the Our App s (the "Third Party
            Partners"). Our App Functions may provide you with location data for basic navigational purposes only and
            are not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where
            erroneous, inaccurate or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or
            environmental damage. Neither US, nor any of its Third Party Partners, guarantee the availability, accuracy,
            completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data displayed by any Our App .</p>
        <p>F. THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS:</p>
        <p>1. Third-Party Services and Content. The Our App s may integrate, be integrated into, bundled, or be provided
            in connection with third-party services, advertising, feeds, and/or content. If you are installing an Our
            App that includes third party services and third party content, such services and content are subject to
            such third party's terms of services and privacy policies, which may be found on the relevant Third Party
            Partner's website. Our App s may provide access or links to Third Party Partner websites or resources. WE
            has no control over such websites and resources, and you acknowledge and agree that Aykut is not responsible
            for the availability of such external websites or resources, and does not endorse nor is responsible or
            liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such websites or
            resources. You further acknowledge and agree that Aykut shall not be responsible or liable, directly or
            indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> connection with use of or reliance on any such Content (as defined below), goods or services available on or
            through any such website or resource. Aykut will not be a party to or in any way be responsible for
            monitoring any transaction between you and Third Party Partners.</p>
        <p>2. Access to Third-Party Services and Content through Our App s. All services, advertising, feeds and
            content, including without limitation, all data, links, articles, graphic or video messages and all
            information, text, software, music, sound, graphics or other materials ("Content") made available or
            accessible through an Our App , whether publicly available or privately transmitted, is the sole
            responsibility of the entity or person from whom it originated. You hereby acknowledge and agree that by
            using an Our App you may be exposed to Content that may be offensive, indecent or objectionable in your
            community. You agree to accept all risks associated with the use of any Content, including any reliance on
            the accuracy or completeness of such Content. Under no circumstances will Aykut be liable in any way for any
            Content created by or originating with entities other than Aykut, including, but not limited to, any errors
            or omissions in any such Content, or for loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the transmission
            or posting of such Content by means of an Our App .</p>
        <p>G. SECURITY: Our App s, like other consumer technologies, may not be 100% secure. By accepting this EULA you
            acknowledge and accept that the Our App s and any information you download or offer to share by means of an
            Our App , may be exposed to unauthorized access, interception, corruption, damage or misuse, and cannot be
            regarded as 100% secure. You accept all responsibility for such security risks and any damage resulting
            therefrom. Further, you are solely responsible for securing your mobile device from unauthorized access,
            including by such means as using complex password protection and, for Android users, enabling device
            encryption in your settings. You agree that Aykut shall not be liable for any unauthorized access to your
            mobile device or the app data thereon.</p>
        <p>H. REGISTRATION/PASSWORDS:</p>
        <p>1. Registration. Most Our App s will not require a registration: however, some Our App s may permit or
            require you to create an account to participate or access additional features or functionalities
            ("Registration"). If such Registration is required, it will be made known to you when you attempt to
            participate or access such additional features or functionalities. Any registration required by a Third
            Party Partner is not governed by this EULA and you should refer to the relevant Third Party Partner's
            website for their policies.</p>
        <p>2. Passwords. You are the sole and exclusive guardian of any password and ID combination issued or chosen by
            to you. Maintaining the confidentiality and security of your password(s) and ID(s) is solely your
            responsibility. You are fully responsible for all transactions undertaken by means of any account opened,
            held, accessed or used via your password and ID. You shall notify us immediately and confirm in writing any
            unauthorized use of accounts or any breach of security, including without limitation any loss, theft or
            unauthorized use of your password(s), and/or ID(s) or any related account. If we have reasonable grounds to
            suspect that the security of your password and/or ID has been compromised, we may suspend or terminate your
            account, refuse any and all current or future use of the services, and pursue any appropriate legal
            remedies. We shall not be responsible for any losses incurred in connection with any misuse of any password
            or ID.</p>
        <p>3. Provided Information. If you provide any information in connection with a Registration, you must provide
            and maintain accurate, complete and current information. If we have reasonable</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> grounds to suspect that your information is inaccurate, not current or not complete, we may suspend or
            terminate your use of the Our App , and pursue any appropriate legal remedies. You agree that we shall have
            the right to use the information you provide to us for the purposes described in this EULA and in

            unregistered, may not be used in connection with any product or service that is not ours, in any manner that
            is likely to cause confusion. Nothing contained in herein should be construed as granting, by implication,
            estoppel or otherwise, any license or right to use any of our trade names, trademarks or service marks
