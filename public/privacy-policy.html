            2. Data We Collect
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5">
        When you use a Mojo Yazılım application ("App"), we or our trusted partners may collect data from your device. This information may directly or indirectly identify you. The data may be stored in identifiable or aggregate formats, ensuring that you cannot reasonably be identified from aggregate data. The types of information we collect include:
        <p>
        Registration Data: If the App offers registration, we collect the data you provide, such as name, email address, and other registration details.
        <p class="mb-5">
        <b>Social Media Logins:</b> Some Apps may allow you to register using social media account details (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). If you choose this option, we collect the information detailed in the "Social Logins" section.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5">
            <b>App Interactions:</b> Data is collected when you post, share materials, upload data, request services, or make selections within the App.

        <p class="mb-5">
            <b>Geolocation Data:</b> We may collect location data, including precise GPS-level data, even when the App is not in active use. This helps us and third parties provide personalized content or offers.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5">
            <b>Social Network Data:</b> Any data you share via linked social media accounts (e.g., Facebook) or public forums, including usage information and connections, may also be collected.

        Important Information About Face Data Collection and Storage
        
        We do not collect face data.
        
        Photos are combined with our API locally on your device for entertainment purposes.
        
        Photos are processed only on your device and are never sent to our servers.
        
        TrueDepth API Usage
        
        If we use Apple’s TrueDepth API technologies (e.g., ARKit for creating AR effects), the data collected remains on your device and is used solely to provide App features. None of this data is stored, processed, or shared externally. For more information, visit Apple’s TrueDepth API documentation.
