        <p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Aykut Doğru ("Aykut", "us", "we", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses
            information when you access or use our websites, mobile application, and other products and services
            (collectively, the "Services"), contact our support staff, or otherwise interact with us.
        <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the
            date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding
            a statement to our website homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy
            Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information
            practices and the choices available to you.</p>
        <p>2. DATA WE COLLECT</p>
        <p>When you use an Aykut Doğru App, WE or its trusted partners may collect data from your mobile device,
            including information which directly or indirectly identifies you. Your information may be kept in an
            identifiable format, or in an aggregate format which means that you cannot reasonably be identified from it.
            The information we collect about you (collectively and individually, the "Information") includes:</p>
        <p>• If an Aykut Doğru App offers you the option to register, we will collect the Information you provide to us
            in the registration form. This may include identification data such as your name, email address or other
            account or registration data.</p>
        <p>• In some cases, an Aykut Doğru App may provide you with the option to register using social media account
            details, like your Facebook, Twitter or other social media account. If you choose to register in this way,
            we will collect the Information described in the section called "Social Logins" below.</p>
        <p>• We will also collect your Information when you use Aykut Doğru Apps such as when you post or share
            material, upload data, request further services or make selections using the Aykut Doğru Apps, if such
            functionality is available in the Aykut Doğru App.</p>
        <p>• If you opt-in, some Aykut Doğru Apps may collect movement data from your phone.</p>
        <p>• We will collect Information about you when you interact with us such as when you report a problem, contact
            or communicate with us.</p>
        <p>• Geolocation data, which is any Information which indicates the geographical position of your device and
            which may include the time the location was recorded, and may include precise (e.g., GPS-level) location
            data. Some Aykut Doğru Apps may collect this data when the App is not open or actively in use (This may help
            us or third parties to customize information, content, or offers to you, for instance.) The Aykut Doğru App
            and/or your mobile device may provide options for you to control the use and/or sharing of precise device
            location data.</p>
        <p>• Any of your Information you provide or permit to be provided to us via a social network or public forum
            provider like Facebook, including when you link an Aykut Doğru App to your social network or public forum
            account (e.g. for registration or social sharing purposes). This data may include your use of the Aykut
            Doğru App on such public forums and/or social networks, including with whom you share the Aykut Doğru App.
            For further information as to how and for what purpose the social network or public forum provider collects,
            uses and shares your data, as well as how you can set your privacy preferences on their site or apps, please
            see their privacy policy.</p>
        <p> We automatically collect certain Information from your device when you use the Aykut Doğru App including
            Information about your device, carrier and other technical data.</p>
        <p>Important information about Face Data Collection and Storage</p>
        <p>1- We don't collect any face data.</p>
        <p>2- We combine photos with our API to produce entertainment content in "user' phone". 3- We only process the
            photo in users phone. No user photo is sent to our servers. About TrueDepth API</p>
        <p>If We use TrueDepth API technologies (ARKit, with automatic estimation of the real-world directional lighting
            environment) to create AR effects within the App. The only use of this information is to provide valuable
            user features. None of the information collected by the TrueDepth API ever leaves the user’s device. We do
            not share information with third parties, do not store or process in any other way the data which we
            accessed and used via TrueDepth API. For more information about TrueDepth API technologies you may visit
            https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208108</p>
        <p>3. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
        <p>We may use the Information (elements of which we may use alone or in combination with each other
            data/Information) we collect to:</p>
        <p>• Deliver the Aykut Doğru Apps to you and ensure their optimal functionality and operation;</p>
        <p>• Enable you to register and create an account with the Aykut Doğru Apps;</p>
        <p>• Provide you with customer support;</p>
        <p>• Perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products, services, or content;</p>
        <p>• If you have registered with an Aykut Doğru App using your social media account details, we may use the
            Information we receive from your social media provider to identify which of your friends are also using the
            Aykut Doğru App so that you can connect with them in our app;</p>
        <p>• Communicate with you by e-mail, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices (including through
            in-application advertising) about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us, our
            parent or subsidiary companies or other third parties. If you do not wish to receive in-application
            advertising, in some cases you can upgrade to the paid version of the app;</p>
        <p>• Develop and display content and advertising (and work with third parties who do so) tailored to your
            interests and/or location and to measure its effectiveness. For instance, we, or these third parties may
            serve music-related ads or offers to users who have installed music-related apps (whether or not these are
            Aykut Doğru Apps). Similarly, users who frequently visit music-related venues may likewise receive ads or
            offers to install music-related apps;</p>
        <p>• Verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with contests and sweepstakes and in order to
            conduct polls and surveys;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> • Enforce our terms, conditions and policies and to communicate with you;</p>
        <p>• Manage and improve the Aykut Doğru App(s). For this purpose, we may use and combine your Information which
            we collect across different Aykut Doğru Apps used by you;</p>
        <p>• When we collect your precise geolocation data (subject to your consent) (which may be via the device's
            cellular, Wi-Fi, Global Positioning System (GPS) networks and/or Bluetooth information), we do so to provide
            you with our location-related products and services, for example to provide you with forecast and weather
            alerts for your location, and also to facilitate, measure, or otherwise support advertising by third parties
            (through our apps or third parties' apps) that may be related to your location over time.</p>
        <p>• When you share your Information with us via a social network provider like Facebook, we use this to show
            Information on your social network profile (subject to your privacy setting and preferences for such social
            network) and to allow you to share Information about our services with your connections or on your social
            network profile.</p>
        <p>4. CROSS-APP ADVERTISING AND OTHER INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING TECHNOLOGIES</p>
        <p>As described in Sections 3 and 5 of this Privacy Policy, we sometimes work with third parties to deliver ads,
            content or offers. Sometimes we or these third parties do so through a mobile "SDK." The SDK is a bit of
            computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected,
            and related services to be implemented. We may use this and similar technology to deliver certain
            advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on data associated with your mobile device, and
            we may work with third parties who likewise embed their SDKs into Aykut Apps, for third party advertising.
            If you'd like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow
            the instructions below. If you wish to opt out of interest-based cross-application tracking through your
            mobile device, you can do so through your device "settings", as follows (but please note that the below is
            for informational purposes only and Apple, Google, or other device platforms may change the manner in which
            their "opt out" settings work at any time): Please note that if you opt out through these settings, you will
            continue to receive advertising after you opt-out, but it may not be tailored to your interests. For
            instance, that advertising may be based on your real-time or "contextual" application usage or general
            location inferred from IP address. Opting Out on iOS Devices Such as iPhones, iPads or iPods If you have an
            Apple device, you can opt out of mobile interest-based or "cross-app" advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or
            higher, and setting Limit Ad Tracking to 'ON'. On an iPhone 6 for example, you can do this by clicking on
            Settings -> General -> Privacy -> Advertising and toggling "Limit Ad Tracking" to 'ON'. Our systems are
            designed to respect your choice and not use Information to provide interest-based advertising when this
            setting is ON. Opting Out on Android Devices</p>
        <p>If you have an Android device and would like to opt out of mobile interest-based or "cross-app" advertising,
            you may do this as follows:</p>
        <p>• Open the Google Settings app on your device</p>
        <p>• Select Ads</p>
        <p>• Opt out of interest-based ads</p>
        <p>We may sometimes work with partners to help us or help them correlate content or ads provided to users across
            devices or browsers. For instance, a brand may wish to use the Information that we collect (or data that its
            own partners collect) to send offers to its customers across both</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> mobile applications and browsers. We thus also provide the links below to the NAI "Consumer Opt-out," DAA
            opt-out, and Google opt-out that are only applicable to participating third parties, which does not include
            US. You may also block certain App Identifiers by changing the settings of your device. However, we do not
            currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry has not
            reached a consensus as to Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions.

        <p>5. SHARING YOUR INFORMATION</p>
        <p>We may share your Information as follows: • We may share your Information with our authorized service
            providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include providing customer service
            and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our Aykut Doğru Apps
            functionality, and supporting marketing promotions (e.g., contests and sweepstakes) surveys and other
            features offered through our Aykut Doğru Apps. These service providers may have limited access to your
            Information, which is needed to perform their functions, but are not permitted to share or use such
            Information for any other purposes.</p>
        <p>• When you engage in promotions offered through the Aykut Doğru Apps, we may share your Information with the
            businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests and/or
            sweepstakes; unless, we have otherwise committed to you that we will not share specific Information you
            provided. When you elect to engage in a particular merchant's offer or program, you authorize us to provide
            your email address and other Information to that merchant.</p>
        <p>• We may also allow third-parties, including our authorized service providers, parent and subsidiary
            companies, affiliates, advertising companies and ad networks, to display advertisements in the Aykut Doğru
            Apps or other apps or use App Identifiers for the purpose of advertising and direct marketing. These
            companies may use technologies to collect data about users, including non-precise and/or precise location
            data, to help them tailor relevant ads and content and analyze and measure ads' effectiveness or, more
            generally, brand and mobile audiences. These companies may collect this data through SDKs or from users who
            view or interact with their advertisements. We combine Information internally at OUR across different Aykut
            Doğru Apps. This means, for example, that we may combine your Information from our Notepad app with
            Information we have about you in our Emoji app. This will enable us to provide more tailored and personal
            experiences and services to you across our family of Aykut Doğru Apps which are described
            www.ad-apps.com</p>
        <p>Other Situations. We may disclose your Information (i) to respond in good faith to a subpoena or similar
            investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government
            agency; (ii) in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal
            activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; (iii) to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of
            our company, our users, our employees, or others; (iv) to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law
            enforcement; (v) to enforce our Aykut Doğru Apps terms and conditions or other agreements or policies; and
            (vi) in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business or the Aykut
            Doğru Apps, a divestiture,</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> merger, consolidation, or asset sale or transfer, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. In addition, we
            may share aggregated Information we collect, under any of the above circumstances, with third parties,
            including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis or
            other legitimate business purposes. Please note that such aggregated Information will not include any
            Information which allows third parties to identity you.</p>
        <p>6. COOKIES, IDENTIFIERS AND DATA ANALYSIS</p>
        <p>We may collect certain device data and electronic identifiers such as the mobile device identifier provided
            by your mobile device operating system, your mobile operating system details and the name of your mobile
            carrier. For example, if you use the iOS platform then Advertiser IDs (also known as "IDFAs" if you have an
            Apple device or "Android Ad IDs" if you have an Android device) may be collected. Other identifiers
            collected may include IP addresses, OpenUDID, Session ID, ODIn1, iOS Vendor IDs, MAC addresses, IMEI,
            Android ID for Android platform, and ODIN1 for OS X (together with the IDFAs, the "App Identifiers"). When
            you use the Aykut Doğru App(s), we may use the App Identifiers to facilitate access to the Aykut Doğru Apps,
            help us recognize you across different Aykut Doğru Apps, to enable you to use the Aykut Doğru Apps, to
            personalize your experience, to increase security, measure the use and effectiveness of our Aykut Doğru Apps
            and serve advertising. You can block certain App Identifiers by changing the settings of your device. We
            also collect information about how and when you use the Aykut Doğru App. This includes the amount of times
            you used the Aykut Doğru App, which parts of it you viewed and other technical data such as country settings
            and timestamps. Firebase uses the Google Analytics tool Firebase in order to carry out analysis on
            Information which is gathered by Our Apps. App Identifiers and other Information which “We” gather are
            provided to Google in order to enable them to carry out data analysis. Any Information (including App
            Identifiers) which are provided to Google will become subject to Google's privacy policy which is located
            here: www.google.com/privacy.html. For further information on how Google's Firebase analytics tool uses
            data, please see the site "How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps", (located at
            www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). Cookies and our Websites Separately to the Aykut Apps, the Aykut
            websites use cookies. Certain information about you, (including personal information), may be collected

            (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your information from
            unauthorized access and disclosure. Please know that, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect
            or impenetrable.</p>
        <p>8. INFORMATION RELATING TO CHILDREN</p>
        <p>The Aykut Doğru Apps are not directed to children under the age of 13. If we become aware that Information
            has been collected from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this Information and terminate the
            person's account as quickly as possible. If you believe that we may have Information from or about a child
            under the age of 13, please contact us at info@ad-apps.com and we will promptly delete that Information.</p>
        <p>9. SOCIAL LOGINS</p>
        <p>Some of the Aykut Doğru Apps may offer you the ability to register and login using your third party social
            media account details (like your Facebook, tiktok or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will
            receive certain profile Information about you from your social media provider. The profile Information we
            receive may vary depending on the Aykut Doğru App you are using, and on the social media provider concerned,

            protective privacy laws than those in your country. The Information may also be processed by any service
            providers appointed by us who operate outside the EEA and their staff, and/or our own staff based outside of
