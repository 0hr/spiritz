   • For every clearly visible person, identify:
     - "id" person id (eg. 1, 2, 3)
     - "emotion" Primary facial emotion (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, neutral).  
     - "confidence" Confidence level (0-1 score reflecting overall certainty).  
     - "cues" Notable body-language cues supporting the emotion.
     - "overall" describe overall in 3-5 sentence.
   • If faces are obscured or ambiguous, state “uncertain” and explain why in "overall" 
2. **Scene / Environment Analysis**  
   • "setting" Summarize the setting (indoor/outdoor, location type, time of day, lighting).  
   • "salient_features" List salient objects or features that influence the scene’s mood.  
   • "atmosphere" Describe the overall atmosphere in 1-2 sentences (e.g., “relaxed summer picnic”, “tense corporate meeting”).
   • "details" Describe the details of the scene in 3-5 sentences. (e.g, Small plates with what look like mezze/tapas remnants: dips, olives, maybe avocado.)
3. Overall Result: "overall" Describe the overall atmosphere in 3-5 sentences. 
4. Status "status", if photo is related about people or scene return true. if not return false.
